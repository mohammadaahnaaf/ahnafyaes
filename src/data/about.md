# Some history

- My parents put a computer in my bedroom in 2003 when I was 3. It was an old Tandy that ran MS-DOS. My favorite games were Road Rash, The House of the Dead 2, Wolfenstein 3D, and GTA: Vice City. It had a mechanical keyboard and a turbo button. To this day, I still don't know what pressing the turbo button really did.

- I still remember installing software from floppy disks onto our brand new PC. It took years for me to send my first email.

- At 7, I discovered the mini-games hidden in Microsoft Office. I also beat Minesweeper on expert for the first time.

- At 8, my parents bought me a Sony digital camera after I stole their SLR one too many times. It could fit 10 images to a floppy disk at a 0.3MP resolution. I still have it, and it still works. I've been taking photographs ever since.

- At 16, I built my first website with Microsoft FrontPage on our Pentium III [Gateway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gateway,_Inc.). My website was terrible.

- At 18, in the summer before University, on March 30th, 2019, I began writing code with Python.

- On September 9th, 2019, I first heard about [Flutter](https://flutter.dev).

- On July 1st, 2020, my birthday, I landed my first job as a Software Engineer.

- On January 7th, 2022, I joined [Munchies](https://munchies.com.bd) as a Software Engineer (FullStack).

- In February 2023, I was promoted to Lead Software Engineer at Munchies.

- In February 2024, I moved to Perth, WA, to pursue my Master of Computing at Curtin University.
