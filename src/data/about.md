# Intro

# Currently

I'm learing design patterns , DevOps , System Design, Backend Development and so on

# Some history

- My parents put a computer in my bedroom in 2003 when I was 3. It was an old Tandy that ran MS-DOS. My favorite games were Road Rash,The House of the Dead 2, Wolfenstein 3D, and GTA: Vice City. It had a mechanical keyboard and a turbo button. To this day, I still don't know what pressing the turbo button really did.

- I still remember installing it from a floppy disk onto our brand new PC. It took years for me to send my first email.


- At 7, I discovered the mini-games hidden in Microsoft Office. I also beat Minesweeper on expert for the first time.

- At 8, my parents bought me a Sony digital camera after I stole their SLR one too many times. It could fit 10 images to a floppy disk at a 0.3MP resolution. I still have it and it still works. I've been taking photographs ever since.

- At 16, I built my first website with Microsoft FrontPage on our Pentium III [Gateway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gateway,_Inc.). My website was terrible.

- At 18, In the summer before University, I finally start writng code with Python.


Ask me in person for other stories that I'm afraid to share with the internet.
